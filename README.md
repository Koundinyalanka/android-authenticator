# android-authenticator

An Android authenticator (i.e. listed in the Android Accounts Manager in the android settings) to be used by other andoid application and with integrated synchronisation of contacts

# TODO

In it's currently state it's just experimentation, did not had time to no much more.

What's left and things to improve:

* contact synchronisation is not finished

Things to improve before being reused by other Android applications:

* right now the authenticator store and provide the password in clear because that's what REST access need since XWiki itself does not provide any token based access by default
