# Android-authenticator

The idea of this project is to integrate a wiki instance in Android accounts, mainly including the synchronization of contacts and the XWiki authenticator. By synchronizing contacts of your company on your phone, it's easy to communicate and collaborate with each other. And the authenticator can also be used to provide credentials for other android apps.
